Designed and deployed a scalable, secure multi-tier e-commerce web application using AWS cloud services, following industry-standard security and architectural best practices.

- Frontend developed using React, hosted on Amazon S3 with CloudFront for global content delivery and low-latency user experience.

- Backend built with Python APIs deployed via Amazon ECS, managed behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for dynamic traffic routing.

- Integrated Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) to manage transactional data such as user accounts, orders, and product inventory.

- Utilized Amazon S3 for image storage and configured IAM roles and policies to ensure secure access control.

- Managed domain routing using Route 53, and enabled SSL/TLS encryption with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for secure HTTPS communication.

- Amazon CloudWatch for dynamic resource scaling and real-time monitoring.
